      <br/> 
      <p>Lakshmana-Rekha stands out with its unique and proactive safety feature. In the event that a user enters a new location without direct interaction, the app autonomously detects the change and issues an alert notification. If the user does not respond, the app takes swift action by sending the live location to designated emergency contacts. In cases of continued non-response, Lakshmana-Rekha initiates direct contact with emergency services (SOS) and simultaneously dispatches distress messages to the user's emergency contacts, ensuring a prompt and effective response to potential threats.</p>
